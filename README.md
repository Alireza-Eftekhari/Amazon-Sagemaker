Prediction model by Amazon Sagemaker 

A particularly important element of Data Analyzing in football is the ability to evaluate a team’s performance in games and use that information to attempt to predict the result of future games based on this data. 

In this script I build a model for expected HomeTeam win in order to better understand a team’s performance in England Premier League and thus to generate better predictions for the future. To build this model I leverage Amazon Sagemaker in order to obtain the best possible performance.
